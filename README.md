# ExamplesSL2Cinvariants
We provide the Mathematica notebooks where we compute the action at the two critical points for the two explicit examples in PAPERREF. In each notebook you can also find the numerical data used for the comparison with the asymptotic formula. 

In [Example-1lowest3halflowest.nb](Example-1lowest3halflowest.nb) you find the example of an invariant with 4 strands (1 with lowest spins and the other 3 with half lowest spins). The spins j,k and the Immirzi parameter <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\gamma"> are arbitrary.

In [Example-4halflowest.nb](Example-4halflowest.nb) you find the example of an invariant with 4 strands (all of them with half lowest spins). The spins j,k and the Immirzi parameter  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\gamma"> are arbitrary.
