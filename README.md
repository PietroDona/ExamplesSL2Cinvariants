# ExamplesSL2Cinvariants
We provide the Mathematica notebooks where we compute the action at the two critical points for the two explicit examples in [Commun.Math.Phys. 389 (2022) 1, 399-437](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00220-021-04154-3). In each notebook you can also find the numerical data used for the comparison with the asymptotic formula. 

In [Example-1lowest3halflowest.nb](Example-1lowest3halflowest.nb) you find the example of an invariant with 4 strands (1 with lowest spins and the other 3 with half lowest spins). The spins j,k and the Immirzi parameter $\gamma$ are arbitrary.

In [Example-4halflowest.nb](Example-4halflowest.nb) you find the example of an invariant with 4 strands (all of them with half lowest spins). The spins j,k and the Immirzi parameter $\gamma$ are arbitrary.
